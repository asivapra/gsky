DOCS: For GSKY - Distributed Scalable Geospatial Data Server
============================================================

FOREWORD
-------------

GSKY was developed at [NCI](http://nci.org.au) and is a scalable, distributed 
server which presents a new approach for geospatial data discovery and delivery 
using OGC standards. The most recent release is version 1.0 (June 2018).

This directoy has all the documents and user guides for the GSKY system. If you find that
anything is missing or requires modifications, please contact the author directly or through
the comments.

These documents - in Word, PowerPoint and PDF - listed in here are intended to 
be useful for a beginner as well as the expert user of GSKY. Though written
mainly for the developers of the system(s), they will also double as user guides for the end users.

The docs are the by-products of the author's very frustrating travel 
through the GSKY code and its associate programs, and go against the new
philosophy of *"why make things simple when they can be wonderfully complex and un-intelligible?"*.

The motivation behind these docs is that no programmer, or the end user 
for that matter, likes to read the docs before diving in. These, mainly animated pictorial docs 
which omits Silvester from them, hopefully eliminate that requirement which, in the case of GSKY, 
was not even an option! For those who dare to RTFM, there are detailed Word documents for most.

So, having alienated most of you with the intro, let us get into the details ! 

Firstly, some mandatory statements...

How to use the documents
----------------------
There are four different types of documents for the same topic, though some may be missing, in here. 
Given below are short instructions on how to use them (which are not intended to be an insult to intelligence!)

- Power Point Presentation (\*.pptx):
	- Open in Power Point 2016 or later.
	- Click 'Slide Show' on menu bar.
	- Uncheck 'Use Timings' (optional)
		- Normally it will auto run the slide show, but it could be too fast or too slow to your liking.
		- Uncheck 'Use Timings' to manually control the timings.
	- Click "From Beginning" or the "slide show icon" on the bottom status bar.

- Power Point Slide Show (\*.ppsx):
	- Open in Power Point 2016 or later. Slide show will start automatically.
	- It will run at the set speed.
	- There is no option to uncheck the timings. 
		- "If you don't like duck, then you are rather stuck" - Basil Fawlty (1975-79).
	- But, here you can fast forward by clicking the right arrow.
		- It will auto start the timed display if you don't click the arrow again to insult it!
	- Or, cancel the timing completely by pressing the left arrow.
		- Then you MUST click the mouse or right arrow to move forward.

- Word document (\*.docx):
	- Open in Word 2016 or later.

- PDF document (\*.pdf):
	- Open in the latest version of Adobe Acrobat.
