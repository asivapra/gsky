      "abstract": "The terrain corrected surface reflectance geometric median (geomedian) is a pixel composite mosaic of a time series of earth observations. Essentially the value of a pixel in a geomedian image is the statistical median of all observations for that pixel from a period of time. For example the 2016 Landsat 8 geomedian image over an area will be the median of Landsat 8 pixels observed for that area in 2016. Multispectral satellite imagery, such as is available from Landsat and Sentinel-2, consists of multiple measurements per pixel: one for each spectral band. In order to create a meaningful median, a median pixel must take all concurrent spectral measurements into account simultaneously as a multi-dimensional set, rather than each measurement independently as occurs with a simple median. The geomedian is a high-dimensional statistic, which calculates a multi-dimensional median from all the spectral measurements from the satellite imagery at the same time, and maintains the relationships among the measurements. This provides a median of the physical conditions measured by the earth observations used to create it, and provides a good representation of a typical pixel observation devoid of outliers, and exhibits reduced spatial noise. Details of the geomedian algortihm are available at https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2017.2723896. As of version 2.0.0, the geometric median products are available as annual datasets, each created from one calendar year of earth observation data from a single satellite. Landsat 5 geometric medians for 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2008 are not included due to lack of sufficient observations.",

      "abstract": "The terrain corrected surface reflectance geometric median (geomedian) is a pixel composite mosaic of a time series of earth observations. Essentially the value of a pixel in a geomedian image is the statistical median of all observations for that pixel from a period of time. For example the 2016 Landsat 8 geomedian image over an area will be the median of Landsat 8 pixels observed for that area in 2016. Multispectral satellite imagery, such as is available from Landsat and Sentinel-2, consists of multiple measurements per pixel: one for each spectral band. In order to create a meaningful median, a median pixel must take all concurrent spectral measurements into account simultaneously as a multi-dimensional set, rather than each measurement independently as occurs with a simple median. The geomedian is a high-dimensional statistic, which calculates a multi-dimensional median from all the spectral measurements from the satellite imagery at the same time, and maintains the relationships among the measurements. This provides a median of the physical conditions measured by the earth observations used to create it, and provides a good representation of a typical pixel observation devoid of outliers, and exhibits reduced spatial noise. Details of the geomedian algortihm are available at https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2017.2723896. As of version 2.0.0, the geometric median products are available as annual datasets, each created from one calendar year of earth observation data from a single satellite.",

      "abstract": "The terrain corrected surface reflectance geometric median (geomedian) is a pixel composite mosaic of a time series of earth observations. Essentially the value of a pixel in a geomedian image is the statistical median of all observations for that pixel from a period of time. For example the 2016 Landsat 8 geomedian image over an area will be the median of Landsat 8 pixels observed for that area in 2016. Multispectral satellite imagery, such as is available from Landsat and Sentinel-2, consists of multiple measurements per pixel: one for each spectral band. In order to create a meaningful median, a median pixel must take all concurrent spectral measurements into account simultaneously as a multi-dimensional set, rather than each measurement independently as occurs with a simple median. The geomedian is a high-dimensional statistic, which calculates a multi-dimensional median from all the spectral measurements from the satellite imagery at the same time, and maintains the relationships among the measurements. This provides a median of the physical conditions measured by the earth observations used to create it, and provides a good representation of a typical pixel observation devoid of outliers, and exhibits reduced spatial noise. Details of the geomedian algortihm are available at https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2017.2723896. As of version 2.0.0, the geometric median products are available as annual datasets, each created from one calendar year of earth observation data from a single satellite.",

The current product (Version 2.1.5) includes observations taken between 1986 and 2017 (inclusive) from the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellites. WOfS covers all of mainland Australia and Tasmania but excludes off-shore Territories. WOfS shows water observed for every Landsat-5, Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 image across Australia (excluding External Territories) for the period of 1986 to 2017. The dataset is updated on as as-needs basis and is expected to increase in update frequency in the future so that as a satellite acquires data, it will automatically be analysed for the presence of water and added to the WOfS product in near real time. Data is provided as Water Observation Feature Layers (WOFLs), in a 1 to 1 relationship with the input satellite data. Hence there is one WOFL for each satellite dataset processed for the occurrence of water.
